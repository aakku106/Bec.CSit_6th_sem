# .NET — Topic-wise Frequency Analysis & Priority List

Based on 5 relevant old question sets. Unit references link to [[DOTNET/Syllabus|Syllabus]].

> ⚠️ **[[DOTNET/Old_sets/2076|2076]] is excluded from the counts below.** It tests classic **ASP** (VBScript, ADO classic, IIS, request/session/application/server objects) — a completely different, outdated technology stack that does not appear anywhere in the current [[DOTNET/Syllabus|Syllabus]] (which is entirely ASP.NET **Core** / C# / EF Core / MVC). Treat 2076 as historical only — don't spend prep time on it.

## Study Priority Summary

1. **Master first:** State Management ([[DOTNET/Syllabus#Unit 6. State Management on ASP.NET Core Application (4 Hrs.)\|Unit 6]]), Controllers/Razor/Tag Helpers/Model Binding ([[DOTNET/Syllabus#Unit 4. Creating ASP.NET core MVC applications (10 Hrs.)\|Unit 4]]), Database access via EF Core & ADO.NET ([[DOTNET/Syllabus#Unit 5. Working with Database (6 Hrs.)\|Unit 5]]), core C# language constructs — exceptions, generics, OOP features ([[DOTNET/Syllabus#Unit 1. Language Preliminaries (8 Hrs.)\|Unit 1]]), jQuery validation & SPA frameworks ([[DOTNET/Syllabus#Unit 7. Client-side Development in ASP.NET Core (4 Hrs.)\|Unit 7]]), Hosting/Deployment ([[DOTNET/Syllabus#Unit 9. Hosting and Deploying ASP.NET Core Application (2 Hrs.)\|Unit 9]]), Security vulnerabilities — especially SQL injection ([[DOTNET/Syllabus#Unit 8. Securing in ASP.NET Core Application (5 Hrs.)\|Unit 8]]), and HTTP/MVC Pattern basics ([[DOTNET/Syllabus#Unit 3. HTTP and ASP.NET Core (3 Hrs.)\|Unit 3]]) — every one of these appears in 4–5 of the 5 relevant papers.
2. **Then cover:** Authorization/Authentication (Unit 8), Dependency Injection & IoC (Unit 4), .NET framework comparisons and architecture (Unit 2), URL routing (Unit 4).
3. **Last, if time remains:** Async/await, indexers, attributes, TempData vs Session vs ViewData, method hiding vs overriding, and Web API action result types — these are newer additions (mostly from the Model set) that may signal where upcoming exams are heading, but haven't repeated across older years yet.

> Note: This subject leans heavily on **hands-on coding questions** (write a program / create a class / write EF Core or ADO.NET code / write jQuery validation) rather than pure theory — practice writing actual C#/Razor/jQuery snippets for each Tier 1 topic instead of only memorizing definitions. Also note the Model set introduces several topics not seen in 2078–2081 (async/await, indexers, TempData, Web API Action Results, method hiding vs overriding) — these look like likely additions for the upcoming exam given the syllabus already covers them in detail.
